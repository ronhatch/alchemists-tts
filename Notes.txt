With this commit, I'm moving all the Lua code out of the mod JSON file and
into an include. The include functionality is not part of the TTS
implementation of Lua, and is instead done from within the Atom editor.

In other words, the #include statement is never part of the code sent to TTS,
and instead the editor modifies the code before sending it across. One of the
consequences of this is that you cannot use the feature in other editors, you
MUST use the Atom editor.

Furthermore, to use the #include statement that I've got, you need to have the
files in the same relative location that I do. It expects to find them in the
Alchemists subdirectory of your normal TTS Saves directory. I recommend using
a shortcut to get to the relevant location. (A soft link is even better, but
since most people don't use Linux that's not going to be a typical setup.)

Details about the Atom #include statement are available here:

The reason I'm making this change is that the code is not very readable in the
format used within the mod JSON file, and as I make additional changes it will
be much more clear what's going on in the diffs provided by GitHub.
