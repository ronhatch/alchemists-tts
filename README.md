# Alchemists-TTS
Re-working the LUA scripting from the Tabletop Simulator Alchemists mod that I'm using, available here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1230898448

My intention is to completely re-write the scripting, and comment on each change as I make it. When I feel that a long explanation is needed, it will go in the Notes.txt file. Explanations are intended to be useful to beginning programmers, since I get the feeling there aren't a lot of high-end examples out there for this particular programming niche.
